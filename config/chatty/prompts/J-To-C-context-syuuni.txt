Context:
The following text I want you to translate is a first-person view
novel. The main characters are '仙台葉月' and '宫城志緒理', both of who are
female college students, and they live together. They are in favor
of each other, but don't want to express their feelings directly.
As the characters are at the same age, 'さん' should be translated
into '同学'.
